License Types (ENTERPRISE)

SIX types of ENTERPRISE licenses are available for this product. These licenses are in two categories: 1) USB Key (SINGLE USER, NETWORK, GLOBAL), and 2) SL (SINGLE-SL, NETWORK-SL, GLOBAL-SL - based on PC or server hardware). The type of license purchased is specified on the invoice or receipt. You assume full responsibility for the safekeeping of the license/registration code you are provided for either type of license.

SINGLE USER - Perpetual, on USB Key. This license grants use of the Software on one computer OTHER than a server, shared drive, or other medium that shares connection with other computers. When the Software is used under this license, it must be used locally. One (1) website user is allowed for each Single User License.

NETWORK - Perpetual, on USB Key. The Network License grants the right to install and use the Software on a local company network. For example, a 10-user Network License grants use of the Software on 10 simultaneous computers, anywhere on the company's local network. It is the users' responsibility to ensure the license/software is allowed/restricted to specific user(s). The Network License is available on USB Key or SL-install, and the number of seats/licenses purchased may be checked in/out over a local network. Three (3) local (same company location) website users are allowed for each Network User License.

GLOBAL - Perpetual, on USB Key. The Global Network License grants the right to install and use the Software on global company network (using VPN). For example, a 10-user Network License grants use of the Software on 10 simultaneous computers, anywhere on the company's global network. It is the users' responsibility to ensure the license/software is allowed/restricted to specific user(s). The Global Network License is available on USB Key or SL-install, and the number of seats/licenses purchased may be checked in/out over a global company network. Four (4) website users are allowed for each Global Network User License.

Activation Types, Limits, and Replacements
USB KEY (HASP HL) - USB Keys are perpetual licenses - they only need to be activated one time, and with any change in product over time (addition of new CAD tools, etc). The perpetual USB Key-based license is the default license priced into the PCB Library Expert. Damaged USB Keys may be replaced by PCBL at cost (varies based on type of license), plus an administrative fee and shipping/handling, provided the damaged USB Key is sent to PCBL and its authenticity can be verified. Lost or stolen keys will not be replaced and the license must be repurchased. It is recommended that customers add this license to the business insurance policy they have to ensure it is covered. PCBL can issue a 30-day temporary license while the insurance process covers for the repurchase of the new license(s).

SINGLE-SL and NETWORK-SL
The HASP "SL" licenses expire at the end of each calendar year, at which time they cease to function unless they either get REFRESHED or REPLACED.
	REFRESH - renewing same License ID (on same machine, or server if a network license)
	REPLACE - issue a new License ID for a new PC or server

There will be no cost to REFRESH nor REPLACE either SL license if in conjunction with an upgrade purchase. If no upgrade is purchased and the license needs to be refreshed for a Library Expert version older than what is currently available at that time (for example refreshing a 2016 license for another 12 months in 2017 without upgrading to version 2017), the 12-month REFRESH will be subject to a non-refundable processing fee of $100. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that older versions of the Library Expert will function as intended - or at all - with newer operating systems, patches, .NET Framework updates, etc.

If the license needs to be installed on a new computer or a new activation is required for whatever reason, a REPLACEMENT license will be required, and will be subject to a non-refundable processing fee of $125; customer and PCBL may need to take steps to terminate all previously issued license(s)/activation(s) that are being replaced. A limit of 3 license replacements are allowed for each VERSION of the Library Expert for which a license is purchased, after which the licenses must be repurchased.

NOTE: All costs associated with REFRESH or REPLACEMENT of SL Licenses are subject to reasonable change year to year.
